# GIF - Harness

This is a GIF harness that can be used to create, introspect, and manipulate GIFs.
It is a simple library that can be used to create GIFs from scratch, or to manipulate existing GIFs.

The harness designation is for its original purpose,
which is to provide a great deal of creation, manipulation, and introspection capabilities
for GIF files to an upcoming open source integrated development environment (IDE).
